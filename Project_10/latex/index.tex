This project contains the following items -\/create an implementation of the Weighted Graph A\+DT usin ga vertex list and an adjacency matrix. -\/\+Develop a routine that finds the shorted path between each pair of vertices in a graph. -\/add vertex coloring and implement a function that checks whether a graph has a proper coloring. -\/investiate the four color theorem by generating a graph for which no proper coloring can be creating using less than five colors.
