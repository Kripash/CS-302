This program contains the necessary functions to implement -\/the timer to test the multiple sort, search, constructor and increment tests.

When mentioning a timer, one has to think about the start time and stop time to get the elapsed time. Timers have different accuracy and in terms of this one, we will implement one up to microseconds. We will have to evaluate the difference in the seconds and the difference in the microseconds measured. this can be solved with the structs of timeval of begin\+Time and duration. We will have a timer\+Was\+Started boolean to tell us if the timer was ever started and if it was stopped.
