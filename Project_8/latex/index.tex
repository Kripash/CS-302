This program contains the necessary functions to implement -\/a Binary Search Tree A\+DT using a linked tree structure

While doing this project I had to keep in mind that I was using the Binary Search Tree to create the data\+Table of the \hyperlink{class_hash_table}{Hash\+Table}. I had to use my Binary Search Tree functions to implement the \hyperlink{class_hash_table}{Hash\+Table} entirely.
