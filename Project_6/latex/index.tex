This program contains the necessary functions to implement -\/the Expression Tree A\+DT using a linked tree structure.

While doing this project, I used various helper functions on top of the functions that were already given and called them recursively, both indirect and direct. In this project, we will learn about preorder, inorder and post order traversals to perform and implement the necessary functions needed for the Expression tree A\+DT using a linked tree structure.
